# Triangulator-2D

A desktop application that triangulates an area defined by the user, written in C++ with SFML.

Click on the screen to place points and draw an area of any form. Then press the Spacebar to finish drawing. If the area defined is valid, then you can press Enter to triangulate.

This application is based on a project I made during my student years, while studying Computational Geometry.
